An 8x8x8 LED cube is a visual treat with 3D effects and patterns. It works on the concept of Persistence of Vision, a feature of the human eye that tricks our brain into thinking that an object is present permanently at a place if it appears about 60 times in a second.
## Introduction

So hey guys I am back with a new article about with a new project in this article, I am going to 
make 8x8x8 Led Cube But this time I am not going to explain that much because I have already explained all the steps of making the 8x8x8 Led Cube In a 16 Minutes Video.

Since an 8x8x8 LED Cube consists of, well 8x8x8 = 512 LEDs, we cannot control all these 512 LEDs at once. What we can do is control 64 LEDs at a time at an extremely fast rate and trick our brain as if we were controlling all the 512 LEDs.

#### I will highly suggest you to watch youtube video if you want to really make a LED cube

As I already said I am not writing this article in much detail because I have made the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbunn9vhaK4) already in detail. You can watch the [video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbunn9vhaK4) But yeah I am promising you that I will update is article as soon as possible.

##  20 working hours.

It took nearly 20 working hours to build the 8x8x8 LED Cube (testing LEDs, bending and cutting the LEDs, making 8 LED Layers each consisting of 64 LEDs, straightening wire for adding tensile strength, stacking those layers vertically, designing PCB, PCB soldering components on the PCB, connecting LED Cube to the PCB, dumping the code and testing the output)


So If you follow all the steps, that in [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbunn9vhaK4) you can easily make this Led Cube
